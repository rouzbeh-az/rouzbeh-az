## :wave: About Me

- **Who I Am**  
  Iâ€™m a Transportation Engineer and Data Scientist specialized in **sustainable system design**, **network resilience analysis**, and **transportation optimization**. I enjoy integrating **big data** and **machine learning** methods to improve large-scale systems and solve real-world challenges.

- **Current Focus**  
  - Researching **transit signal priority** strategies and optimizing electric bus routes to reduce emissions and improve efficiency.  
  - Building robust **data-driven** solutions, from anomaly detection for industrial equipment to optimization models for large transportation networks.

- **Fun Fact**  
  - In my spare time, I love off-roading, snow-wheeling, and overlanding. A little adrenaline never hurts!
